Hello! I'm Joseph Phillips. I am a Lecturer in Politics (Assistant Professor) at the [School of Law and Politics](https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/law-politics) at Cardiff University. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Kent from 2021-2024, and a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Exeter from 2020-2021. I received my PhD in 2021 from the Department of Political Science at the Pennsylvania State University. Prior to this, I received an MA in Political Science from the Pennsylvania State University in 2019 and a BA in Political Science and History from SUNY Purchase College.

My research concerns polarization and misinformation, focusing on how they arise and their implications for liberal democracy. Much of my work takes a longitudinal approach to both survey and experimental data. While my training is in American politics, much of my more recent work uses samples from several advanced democracies. Future work will make ample use of data from panel surveys of adults and adolescents in the United Kingdom PSYPOL is currently preparing.

My work has been published in journals such as _Aggressive Behavior_, _Electoral Studies_, the _European Journal of Public Health_, _Human Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics_, the _International Journal of Press/Politics_ the _Journal of Experimental Political Science_, _Journal of Politics_, _Nature Human Behaviour_, _PLoS One_, _PNAS Nexus_, _Political Behavior_, and _Vaccine_, as well as other edited outlets. You can find an up-to-date list of publications on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=kfmCx_kAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).
